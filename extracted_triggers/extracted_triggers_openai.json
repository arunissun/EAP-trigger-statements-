This information in the form of 2 maps makes it possible to visualize the districts likely to receive significant rainfall in a week. Knowing that a watershed can cover 2 or more districts Trigger mechanism (1 to 7 days delay): The activation trigger will be reached when the weekly forecast bulletin of the river watersheds and the important flood warnings/advisories predict exceptionally high precipitation heights: greater than a cumulative precipitation of 150 mm (i.e. in the category of \"abundant\" according to the DGM classification, see Appendix) After the activation trigger within 3 to 7 days, the MRC will initiate the process of disseminating early warning messages and bulletins (evacuation messages) to the target population along the Matatana and Manapatrana River basin. It is important to note that the weekly DGM forecast used will be coupled with local information based on local population knowledge of the behavior of the Matatana and Manapatrana rivers. Markers (often natural such as rocks or trees) are identified by the local population so that the rise in water levels will be confirmed when the water level reaches these beacons. It should also be noted that in the rainy season, with heavy rain, the DGM also issues daily heavy rain (and flood) vigilance bulletins for the monitoring of rising waters. With the modelling tool, the cumulative rainfall predicted by the DGM will be transformed into the height of water accumulated on the surface and in the flood zone and therefore the identification of the most vulnerable communities. The activation trigger with a 3–7-day delay will also trigger the identification of the most vulnerable communities for the intervention of anticipatory actions (in consultation with the respective provincial and district management authorities), followed by the validation/registration of the beneficiaries of the assistance, as anticipatory actions.",

The Trigger system used is a 5-day Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) product of Department of Meteorology & Hydrology (DMH) forecasts - daily maximum temperature & humidity corresponding to a heat index (HI) of more than 90 percentile values for the summer months (March-May), which is 62.6 for Kaba Aye (Yangon) & 58.2 for Mandalay, for at least three consecutive days, with a lead time of maximum 5 days. The lead time of 5 days includes the 3 days heatwave duration. As parameters can be forecasted maximum 5 days in advance, the HW can be forecasted as early as 2 days and as late as just before the HW onset. In case of sudden changes in the forecast, the activation can be triggered on days –4 and -3. For clarification, please refer to Annex I. The confirmation of trigger will initiate early action activities with the targeted population of the corresponding region, which includes setting up FA posts, with shading places and water stands, Heat Awareness / FA visits including the preparation for the cash assistance.

This means, for the cash activity, all the related activities will be conducted when the trigger is reached, but the cash distribution per se will only be implemented during the forecasted heatwave period with a minimum of 48h lead time. And this will be confirmed only when observed HI value surpasses the thresholds for that day and the forecasted HI values for next two days are also surpassing the thresholds, as DMH NWP are more reliable and accurate for 2-3 days lead time only.

This also includes the river level forecast information of Karnali, Babai and West Rapti at Chisapani, Chepang and Kusum stations respectively.

Also, in case of any significant weather phenomenon, special weather advisories or flood advisories are also issued by DHM a few days in advance.

The seismic network consists now in 7 seismic stations. Each station is composed of a seismometer and various electronic devices for radio transmissions (modulator, transceiver). Telemetered radio analogical signals of seismic stations are received at the observatory where they are digitalized. A real time analogical control is supplied for 3 stations at the observatory using a lennartz drum recorder with thermic paper. Deformations monitoring is performed with: - A permanent inclinometric station composed by 4 blum-type silica inclinometers. Measurements are repeated each minute and transmitted to the observatory by radio. The orange alert is triggered when an imminent danger is detected - an anomaly higher than normal (second-level seismic crisis, second level micro-deformation of the ground, and change in the composition of gases through the accumulation of carbon dioxide) that persists for several hours a day. It includes three types of alerts that are activated after receipt of the special bulletins of level 1 for the yellow alert, level 2 for the orange alert and level 3 for the red alert, which are monitored through the periodic forecasts shared by OVK two weeks, four days and two days before the impact respectively for the yellow, the orange and the red alert. The early action trigger threshold is reached, when the CRCS receives the special orange alert bulletin (OVK-SB2) four days before the impact (fig.2). This will allow the steering committee, despite the preparedness and pre-positioning activities carried out, to proceed with the distribution of sanitation, WASH and dignity kits. If there is a need to relocate exposed populations, the CRCS will provide technical support during site identification and evacuation and will provide psychosocial support to affected populations. The red alert is reached, when the CRCS receives the special level 3 bulletin (OVK-BS3), in which case the CRCS will proceed directly to the distribution of dust masks and protective glasses to the most at-risk population before their evacuation.
